How to resize ASM disk / diskgroup on 3Par
------------------------------------------

As root:
lvresize /dev/db02vg/UATAGY11DATA01 -L 35g
35g is the new size (not how much you are adding, there is a separate option for that).


As oragrid:

cd sql
sqlasm
@GetASMdiskgroups.sql

ALTER DISKGROUP UATAGY11_DATA01 RESIZE ALL;

@GetASMdiskgroups.sql


Sometimes the existing disk groups will be 2TB in size and the above command will fail. Then you will need to add a new Disk using AMSCA. Initially you will have the space from the new disk addition but when it fills up and Unix team extend that disk the above command will fail. In such a situation you need to just extend the disk in question using the below command

ALTER DISKGROUP PRDSEF11_DATA01 RESIZE DISK PRDSEF11_DATA03 SIZE 950G;

NetApp
------------------

As Oracle
dd if=/dev/zero of=/opt/contexts/prd-eqd-data1/PRDEQD02_DATA11 bs=4k count=26214400
dd if=/dev/zero of=/opt/contexts/prd-eqd-data2/PRDEQD02_DATA12 bs=4k count=26214400
chmod g+w /opt/contexts/prd-eqd-data1/PRDEQD02_DATA11
chmod g+w /opt/contexts/prd-eqd-data2/PRDEQD02_DATA12

As oragrid
cd sql
sqlasm
@GetASMdiskgroups.sql
alter diskgroup PRDEQD02_DATA01 add disk '/opt/contexts/prd-eqd-data1/PRDEQD02_DATA11','/opt/contexts/prd-eqd-data2/PRDEQD02_DATA12';
alter diskgroup PRDEQD02_DATA01 rebalance power 6;
select * from v$asm_operation;
select name,total_mb, free_mb  from V$ASM_DISK where name like 'PRDEQD02_D%';

----------------------
Issue when you run oracleasm as root (which you almost always do) on a new server, it might end up creating the disks in "/dev/oracleasm/disks" with root as the owner which the grid installer will not recognise as a candidate disk. In this case what has happened is oracleasm has not been configured. To do this you will need to run oracleasm configure -i as so.

oracleasm configure -i
Configuring the Oracle ASM library driver.

This will configure the on-boot properties of the Oracle ASM library
driver.  The following questions will determine whether the driver is
loaded on boot and what permissions it will have.  The current values
will be shown in brackets ('[]').  Hitting <ENTER> without typing an
answer will keep that current value.  Ctrl-C will abort.

Default user to own the driver interface []: oragrid
Default group to own the driver interface []: asmadmin
Start Oracle ASM library driver on boot (y/n) [y]: y
Scan for Oracle ASM disks on boot (y/n) [y]: y
Writing Oracle ASM library driver configuration: done
