===== CREATING and ATTACHING VOLUME WINDOWS ====
We cannot create and attach volumes on windows as it fails with a permission error. So we just create a volume with docker 

using 

docker volume create --name utcdata -d local

http://www.lukaszewczak.com/2016/09/run-postgresql-using-docker-with.html

docker run -p 25432:5432 --name pgdevddb -d --volume utcdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:11.6



need to try

docker run -p 5432:5432 -it -v /c/Users/me/Desktop/pg/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:latest -e POSTGRES_USER=user POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password

=====================

docker ps --> report running containers.
docker ps -a --> report all containers running and exited previously
docker stop <name>/<containerid> --> stop a running container.
docker rm --> to remove the container that is stopped or exited.


docker images --> which have been downloaded.

docker rmi <image name> --> delete the downloaded image.

docker pull image --> just to pull down the image and not run a container.

docker run image --> just runs a command and exits immediately.

docker exec <containername> <command>

docker run -d <imagename>

docker attach container
