RECOMMEND: There are events set that should be removed before upgrade, unless your application vendors and/or Oracle Support state differently.  Changes will need to be made in the pfile/spfile. [TSTAGY02]
RECOMMEND: Gathering statistics on fixed objects, if none have been gathered yet, is recommended prior to upgrading.<br><br>For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 11.2.0.4 Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide. [TSTAGY02]
RECOMMEND: Dictionary statistics provide essential information to the Oracle optimizer to help it find efficient SQL execution plans. After a database upgrade, statistics need to be re-gathered as there can now be tables that have significantly changed during the upgrade or new tables that do not have statistics gathered yet. [TSTAGY02]
RECOMMEND: Fixed object statistics provide essential information to the Oracle optimizer to help it find efficient SQL execution plans.  Those statistics are specific to the Oracle Database release that generates them, and can be stale upon database upgrade.<br><br>For information on managing optimizer statistics, refer to the 11.2.0.4 Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: Inactve AWR DBIDs should be updated after the upgrade completes. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: Network access control list (ACL) privileges in 11g will be migrated to a new format in 12c. As part of the migration, new DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN interfaces and dictionary views are provided, and privileges in the existing ACLs will be converted to the new format with new ACL names. The old ACL names, DBMS_NETWORK_ACL_ADMIN interfaces and dictionary views may continue to be used but are deprecated and their use is discouraged. For further information, refer to My Oracle Support note number 2078710.1. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: There should be no INVALID objects in SYS/SYSTEM or user schemas before database upgrade. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: Starting in Release 18c, symbolic links are not allowed in directory object paths used with BFILE data types, the UTL_FILE package, or external tables. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: If the -T option is used to set user tablespaces to READ ONLY during the upgrade, user tables in those tablespaces, that are dependent on Oracle-Maintained types, will not be automatically upgraded. If a type is evolved during the upgrade, any dependent tables need to be re-validated and upgraded to the latest type version AFTER the database upgrade completes. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: Starting with Oracle Database release 12.2.0.1, Exclusive Mode is the new default password-based authentication mode. All Exclusive Mode login/authentication attempts will fail for preexisting user accounts which only have the 10G password version and neither the 11G or 12C password version (see DBA_USERS.PASSWORD_VERSIONS.) For more information, refer to "Understanding Password Case Sensitivity and Upgrades" in the Oracle Database Upgrade Guide. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: Starting with Oracle Database release 12.2, Exclusive Mode is the default password-based authentication mode. Case insensitive password authentication is not supported in Exclusive Mode. If your system needs to use case insensitive password authentication, Exclusive Mode must be switched off prior to the upgrade. See the Network Reference Manual chapter about the SQLNET.ORA parameter SQLNET.ALLOWED_LOGON_VERSION_SERVER for more details on Exclusive Mode. [TSTAGY02]
WARNING: Oracle recommends upgrading to the desired (latest) version of the time zone file.  For more information, refer to "Upgrading the Time Zone File and Timestamp with Time Zone Data" in the 19 Oracle Database Globalization Support Guide. [TSTAGY02]
